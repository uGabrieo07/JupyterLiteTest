    "Let **A** be a linear operator on a finite-dimensional vector\n",

    "eigenvectors of **A** corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are linearly\n",
    "independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let *m* be the number of distinct eigenvalues, and ${\\alpha i}$, i = 1,\n",
    "â€¦, *m* be a set of complex numbers such that\n",
    "$$\\alpha_1 \\mathbf{v_1} + \\alpha_2 \\mathbf{v_2} + \\dots + \\alpha_\\textit{m} \\mathbf{v_\\textit{m}} = 0$$\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{v_i}$ is an eigenvector of $\\mathbf{A}$ corresponding to\n",
    "the eigenvalue $\\lambda_i$. If we premultiply both sides of the equation\n",
    "above by\n",

    "$$\\alpha_1(\\lambda_1 - \\lambda_2)(\\lambda_1 - \\lambda_3)\\dots(\\lambda_1-\\lambda_m)\\mathbf{v}_1 = 0$$\n",
    "which implies $\\alpha_1 = 0$, because $\\lambda_i \\ne \\lambda_j$ for\n",

    "we get $\\alpha_2 = 0$. After we repeat the procedure for all\n",
    "$\\mathbf{v_i}$, $i = 1, \\dots, m$, we conclude that\n",
    "$\\alpha_1 = \\alpha_2 = \\dots = \\alpha_m = 0$, therefore the vectors\n",
    "$\\mathbf{v_1}, \\dots, \\mathbf{v_m}$ are linearly independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of eigenvalues of **A** cannot exceed *n*, the dimension of\n",
    "the vector space $\\mathcal{U}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evidence:** This corollary follows immediately from the theorem, for\n",
    "we cannot have more than *n* linearly independent vectors in a vector\n",
    "space whose dimension is *n*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have just seen that each linear operator has at least one pair of\n",
    "eigenvalue and eigenvector, that eigenvectors associated with distinct\n",
    "eigenvalues are linearly independent, and that the maximum number of\n",
    "distinct eigenvalues is the dimension of the vector space, *n*.\n",
    "Equivalently, we can also say that the number of linearly independent\n",
    "eigenvectors cannot exceed *n*, the dimension of the vector space.\n",
    "Furthermore, we may also find cases in which a single eigenvalue is\n",
    "associated with multiple linearly independent eigenvectors, which\n",
    "characterizes an eigenvalue of geometrical multiplicity greater than\n",
    "one. However, can we ascertain that n linearly independent eigenvectors\n",
    "do exist? In other words, do the eigenvectors of a linear operator span\n",
    "the whole vector space? In some cases, yes, but unfortunately, the\n",
    "answer is no for the general case: the eigenvectors of a linear operator\n",
    "A in $\\mathcal{U}$ do not necessarily span $\\mathcal{U}$ .\n",
    "\n",
    "If **A** has *n* distinct and real eigenvalues, then there are *n*\n",
    "linearly independent corresponding eigenvectors, which span\n",
    "$\\mathbb{R}^n$. This is equivalent to saying that if **A** has *n*\n",
    "distinct and real eigenvalues, then the corresponding eigenvectors form\n",
    "a basis of $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n",

    "Let us investigate a toy example.\n",

    "            \\end{bmatrix}$$ By inspection, e can identify\n",
    "$\\mathbf{v} = [1\\;0]^T$ as eigenvector of A associated with the\n",
    "eigenvalue $\\lambda = 1$. We shall anticipate that any attempt to find\n",
    "another eigenvector of **A** linearly independent with respect to **v**\n",
    "will be frustrating. We will soon learn that the eigenvalues of a\n",
    "triangular matrix are revealed on its main diagonal. Therefore, the\n",
    "eigenvalues in this example are both equal to one,\n",
    "$\\lambda_1 = \\lambda_2 = 1$, and the previous Corollary does not apply.\n",
    "The eigenvalue $\\lambda = 1$ has geometrical multiplicity equal to 1.\n",

    "# Diagonalizing Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "If possible, it is often useful to work with diagonal matrices which are\n",
    "similar to the square, but otherwise generic matrix $\\mathbf{A}$. This\n",
    "requires the existence of a similarity transformation which yields a\n",
    "matrix $\\mathbf{\\Lambda}$ diagonal and similar to $\\mathbf{A}$. Given\n",
    "$\\mathbf{A}$, a linear operator in some vector space $\\mathcal{V}$ with\n",
    "dimension $n$, if its eigenvectors form a basis of $\\mathcal{V}$, then\n",
    "the matrix $\\mathbf{V}$ constructed with the $n$ linearly independent\n",
    "eigenvectors of $\\mathbf{A}$ is invertible. Therefore $\\mathbf{A}$ is\n",
    "diagonalizable, because\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{If } \\exists \\, \\mathbf{V}^{-1}, \\text{ then } \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{V} = \\mathbf{V} \\mathbf{\\Lambda} \\iff \\mathbf{V}^{-1} \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{V} = \\mathbf{\\Lambda}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From the Corollary ?? given above, we can state the following theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let a linear operator in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ be induced by matrix\n",
    "$\\mathbf{A}$ which has $n$ distinct and real eigenvalues. Matrices\n",
    "$\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{\\Lambda}$, a diagonal matrix whose elements\n",
    "are the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{A}$, are similar according to the\n",
    "Definition ??.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $n$ eigenvalues are real and distinct, therefore according to\n",
    "Corollary ?? the corresponding $n$ eigenvectors are linearly\n",
    "independent. We can construct a matrix with the eigenvectors as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{V} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{v}_1 & \\mathbf{v}_2 & \\cdots & \\mathbf{v}_n \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is invertible. Therefore\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{V} = \\mathbf{V} \\mathbf{\\Lambda} \\iff \\mathbf{V}^{-1} \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{V} = \\mathbf{\\Lambda}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which concludes the proof.\n",
    "\n",
    "The similarity between the linear operator $\\mathbf{A}$ and the diagonal\n",
    "matrix $\\mathbf{\\Lambda}$ allows us to formulate the following remarks:\n",
    "Linear operators whose eigenvalues are distinct and real are\n",
    "**diagonalizable**, and the diagonalizing procedure is a similarity\n",
    "transformation using the matrix formed by the eigenvectors. If the\n",
    "eigenvectors of a linear operator A in U form a basis of U, then in such\n",
    "basis the operator A is induced,or represented, by the diagonal matrix\n",
    "$\\Lambda$, the matrix of the eigenvalues of A. Although the requirement\n",
    "of *n* distinct and real eigenvalues can be too restrictive, the theorem\n",
    "does not state that matrices with less than *n* distinct eigenvalues\n",
    "cannot be diagonalized. The following example illustrates one case in\n",
    "wich a matrix does not have *n* distinct eigenvalues and still can be\n",
    "diagonalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{A} = \n",

    "\n",
    "By inspection we can verify that $\\lambda_1 = 2$, $\\lambda_2 = 1$, and\n",
    "$\\lambda_3 = 1$ are eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{A}$ associated with the\n",
    "respective eigenvectors\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{v}_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad\n",
    "\\mathbf{v}_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad\n",
    "\\mathbf{v}_3 = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "because each pair $(\\lambda_i, \\mathbf{v}_i)$ satisfies\n",
    "$\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{v}_i = \\lambda_i \\mathbf{v}_i$. There are $n$\n",
    "linearly independent eigenvectors, i.e., the set\n",
    "$\\{ \\mathbf{v}_1, \\mathbf{v}_2, \\mathbf{v}_3 \\}$ spans $\\mathbb{R}^3$,\n",
