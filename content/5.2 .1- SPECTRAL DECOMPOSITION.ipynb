    "If $\\mathbf{A}$ is a real and symmetric matrix and has $n$ distinct and\n",
    "real eigenvalues, then there are $n$ orthogonal, or orthonormal if\n",
    "properly normalized, corresponding eigenvectors, which span\n",
    "$\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. This is equivalent to saying that if\n",
    "$\\mathbf{A}=\\mathbf{A}^{T}$ has $n$ distinct and real eigenvalues, then\n",
    "the corresponding eigenvectors form an orthogonal, or orthonormal, basis\n",
    "of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\lambda_{1}$ and $\\lambda_{2}$ be eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{A}$, real\n",
    "and symmetric, with $\\lambda_{1} \\neq \\lambda_{2}$. Let $\\mathbf{u}_{1}$\n",
    "and $\\mathbf{u}_{2}$ be the corresponding eigenvectors. Let\n",
    "$<\\cdot, \\cdot>$ denote the canonic inner product, such that\n",
    "$\\mathbf{u}_{1} \\perp \\mathbf{u}_{2} \\Leftrightarrow<\\mathbf{u}_{1}, \\mathbf{u}_{2}>=0$.\n",

    "\n",
    "because $\\mathbf{A}=\\mathbf{A}^{\\mathrm{T}}$, or equivalently,\n",
    "$\\mathbf{A}$ is self-adjoint. Using the definition of eigenvectors and\n",

    "A consequence of the theorem above is that if\n",
