    "# Permutations and the PLU Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "Any matrix $A : \\mathbb{R}^{m} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ admits a\n",
    "decomposition as a permutation matrix $P$, a lower triangular matrix $L$\n",
    "with all elements in the main diagonal equal to one, and an upper\n",
    "triangular matrix $U$, i.e., $A = PLU$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It suffices to prove that $U = L^{-1}PA$, where $L^{-1}$, being the\n",
    "inverse of $L$, is also lower triangular with all elements of the main\n",
    "diagonal equal to one. We will use the fact that a composite of lower\n",
    "triangular linear operations is also lower triangular, and also that a\n",
    "composite of permutations is also a permutation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us start the proof assuming that the first column of $A$ has at\n",
    "least one non-zero element. If this is not the case, nothing needs to be\n",
    "done for the first column, and the decomposition starts with the second\n",
    "column of $A$. In order to make the element in the position $(1,1)$\n",
    "different from zero, we need to apply a permutation $P_1$ that exchanges\n",
    "the first and any $k$-th row of $A$, given that the element of $A$ in\n",
    "position $(k,1)$ is different from zero. This operation shall give us\n",
    "$\\tilde{A}_1 = P_1A$. Now we can apply a succession of operations for\n",
    "the elimination of each nonzero element of the first column of\n",
    "$\\tilde{A}_1$. Therefore we have $A_1 = T_1P_1A$, where $T_1$ is the\n",
    "lower triangular matrix which is a composite of linear operations that\n",
    "eliminate elements $(i,1)$, $i = 2, \\dots, n$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T_1 = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "1 & 0 & 0 & \\dots & 0 \\\\\n",
    "* & 1 & 0 & \\dots & 0 \\\\\n",
    "0 & * & 1 & \\dots & 0 \\\\\n",
    "\\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n",
    "0 & 0 & 0 & \\dots & 1\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}, \\quad A_1 = T_1P_1A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "* & * & \\dots & * \\\\\n",
    "0 & * & \\dots & * \\\\\n",
    "\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n",
    "0 & 0 & \\dots & *\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we proceed with elimination of terms for the second column, the\n",
    "third column, and so on, until we find a particular column, say, the\n",
    "$j$-th column, whose element in position $(j,j)$ is equal to zero in the\n",
    "transformed matrix $A_{j-1} = T_{j-1} \\dots T_1P_1A$. If this element is\n",
    "not in the last row $(n)$, it means we need to exchange the $j$-th and\n",
    "$l$-th rows, $l > j$ chosen such that the element in position\n",
    "$(l,j) \\neq 0$. This action is performed by the permutation matrix\n",
    "$P_j$, which yields $\\tilde{A}_j = P_jT_{j-1} \\dots T_1P_1A$. If there\n",
    "is no element which satisfies the nonzero condition, elimination is\n",
    "ready for this column, there is no need for permutation, and we can\n",
    "proceed to the next column. For simplicity, we will combine the\n",
    "composition of all matrices $T_{j-1} \\dots T_1$ as a single matrix\n",
    "$T_{j-1,1}$, which is lower triangular with all elements in its main\n",
    "diagonal equal to one, all other elements equal to zero, except those in\n",
    "columns $1, \\dots, j-1$. Therefore $\\tilde{A}_j = P_jT_{j-1,1}P_1A$. The\n",
    "transformation which eliminates the elements below the position $(j,j)$\n",
    "in $\\tilde{A}_j$ is $T_j$. Now we have $A_j = T_jP_jT_{j-1,1}P_1A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A_j = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "* & * & \\dots & * & * \\dots * \\\\\n",
    "0 & * & * & \\dots & * \\dots * \\\\\n",

    "0 & 0 & 0 & \\dots & * \\dots * \\\\\n",
    "0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\dots & * \\\\\n",
    "0 & \\dots & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\dots * \\\\\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Although $A$ has the zeros in the proper places, the sequence of\n",
    "transformations is not in the order we want, because $T_jP_jT_{j-1,1}$\n",
    "is not lower triangular. However, as $P_jP_j = I$, we can rewrite $A_j$\n",
    "as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A_j = T_jP_jT_{j-1,1}P_1A$$ $$= T_jP_jT_{j-1,1}P_jP_jP_1A$$\n",
    "$$= T_j\\tilde{T}_{j-1,1}P_jP_1A$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\tilde{T}_{j-1,1} = P_jT_{j-1,1}P_j$ is lower triangular with all\n",
    "elements in the main diagonal equal to one, all other elements equal to\n",
    "zero, except those located in the columns $1, \\dots, j-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we proceed towards the $m$-th column, whenever an element in the\n",
    "diagonal is zero, we may apply the permutation as above, which\n",
    "guarantees that all elements below the main diagonal are eliminated and\n",
    "the decomposition is performed with a sequence of lower triangular\n",
    "matrices followed by a sequence of permutation matrices, as described.\n",
    "The product of all lower triangular matrices is denoted by $L^{-1}$ and\n",
    "the product of all elementary permutation matrices is denoted by $P$.\n",
    "The result is an upper triangular matrix $U = L^{-1}PA$, or\n",
    "equivalently, $A = PLU$."
